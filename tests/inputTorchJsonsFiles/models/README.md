# Torch Test Models

This directory hosts TorchScript `.pt` artifacts consumed by the Torch full-flow test harness.

`placeholder_perceptron.pt` is auto-generated by `tests/scripts/generate_torch_test_model.py` (a tiny TorchScript perceptron). Regenerate it prior to running the Torch full-flow test so worker JSON definitions can load the model successfully.
